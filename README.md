# NON-LINEAR_REGRESSION
If the data shows a curvy trend, then linear regression will not produce very accurate results when compared to a non-linear regression because, as the name implies, linear regression presumes that the data is linear.In this notebook, I fitted a non-linear model to the data points corresponding to China's GDP from 1960 to 2014.
